# Numbers-Station
Inspired by numbers stations heard on shortwave radio, this will create a one-time-pad and encode your message into numbers.
-------------

**How to use:**

1: Execute the "generate-numbers.py" file, it will create a "one_time_pad.txt" file.


2: Execute the "encode-message.py" file and type whatever message you want. It will read from the above file and generate some numbers according to the file above.


3: If you're using text-to-speech software to read the numbers, execute the "group-numbers-for-tts.py" file. If you prefer to read the numbers yourself, execute the "group-numbers.py" file instead.


4: Execute the "create-human-readable-otp.py" file, which will generate a human-readable text file from the "one_time_pad.txt" file, give this newly generated file to your intended recipient.
