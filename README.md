# Numbers-Station
Inspired by numbers stations heard on shortwave radio, this will create a one-time-pad and encode your message into numbers.
-------------

**How to use:**

1: Execute the "generate-numbers.py" file.
2: Execute the "encode-message.py" file and type whatever message you want.
3: If you're using text-to-speech software to read the numbers, execute the "group-numbers-for-tts.py" file. If you prefer to read the numbers yourself, execute the "group-numbers.py" file instead.
4: Execute the "create-human-readable-otp.py" file, which will generate a file you can give to your intended recipient.
